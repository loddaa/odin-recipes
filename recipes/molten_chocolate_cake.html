                    This is the original, supremely rich version of the iconic molten chocolate cake, created by Jean-Georges Vongerichten.

                <p>
                    It seems as though every restaurant in America offers a version of this amazing chocolatey cake, but the original is in a class by itself. Molten chocolate cake became famous for a reason: It's cakey on the outside with an irresistible center of flowing warm dark chocolate. The first time you try one, it may seem like magic, but this chocolate molten cake recipe is actually quite easy to make and ready in under an hour. Be sure to use the finest quality chocolate — it will make a big difference.

                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Preparation</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat oven to 450°F. Butter and lightly flour four 6-ounce ramekins. Tap out excess flour. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a double boiler, over simmering water, melt butter with chocolate. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a medium bowl, beat eggs with egg yolks, sugar, and salt at high speed until thickened and pale. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whisk melted chocolate until smooth. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Quickly fold it into egg mixture, along with flour. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spoon batter into prepared ramekins and bake for 12 minutes, or until sides of cakes are firm but centers are soft.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let cakes cool in ramekins for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted dessert plate. Carefully turn each cake over, let stand for 10 seconds, and then unmold. Serve immediately.   
                    </li>
                </ol>
