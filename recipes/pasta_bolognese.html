                    Our Bolognese pasta features a traditional combination of ground beef, pork, veal, and tomato studded with salt-cured pancetta. It's tossed with penne rigate and served with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

                <p>
                    Bolognese isn't your typical tomato-based spaghetti sauce. It originated in Bologna, Italy, and is a hearty ragù that starts with a soffritto — that all-important blend of finely diced onion, carrot, and celery — loaded up with a variety of ground meats and cooked with white wine. Then, a relatively small amount of tomatoes are added along with stock; the sauce is cooked slow and low to develop and concentrate the flavors. To finish, it's enriched with a touch of cream.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan until shimmering. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Scrape the vegetable mixture into a large bowl. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to the saucepan and heat until just shimmering. Add the beef, veal and cook over moderately high heat until just barely pink, about 5 minutes.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Return the vegetable mixture to the saucepan. Add the garlic and cook over high heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost evaporated, about 8 minutes. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stir in the tomatoes and their juices, the chicken stock, thyme, and bay leaf. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and bring to a boil over high heat. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cover partially and cook over moderately low heat for 1 hour. Discard the bay leaf. Stir in the heavy cream and cook the sauce just until heated through. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente.    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drain well, return to the pot, add the sauce, and toss.     
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve the pasta in deep bowls and pass the Parmesan at the table. 
                    </li>
