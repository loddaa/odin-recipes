            <h3>
                Warm Goat’s Cheese Salad is a classic starter found in bistros all across France.
                Called Salade de Chêvre Chaud, it’s a fresh leaf salad with nuts and bacon, and crowned with pan-fried goat’s cheese medallions that are golden outside and oozing inside. 
            </h3>

            <p>
                Some dishes are showstoppers, while others are ordinary, unfussy and exactly what you want on a slow evening when nothing need be achieved or sought after.
                This is a simple salad, with the smallest exalting touch: rounds of goat cheese coated in beaten egg and the sheerest veil of bread crumbs, then gently pressed in a hot pan until dark gold.
                They come served over a careless toss of greens — you can add fresh herbs like dill or parsley for featheriness and a bright lift — in a dressing that requires no more than oil, vinegar, mustard and a single shallot.
                Eat immediately, when the greens are fresh and cool, and the cheese is still warm, faintly crackly on the outside and oozy within.

                <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Prepare the goat cheese: In a shallow dish, mix the bread crumbs, salt and pepper.
                    Crack the egg into a separate bowl and beat with a fork. 
                    Using unflavored dental floss or a sharp knife, cut the goat cheese into ½-inch-thick rounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dip each round in the beaten egg, then dredge in the crumbs until completely covered, and transfer to a plate. 
                    Refrigerate until very firm, at least 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, make the salad: In a large bowl, whisk the vinegar, mustard and shallot with a pinch each of salt and pepper. 
                    While whisking, add the oil in a slow, thin stream and mix until emulsified. 
                    Add the greens and gently toss to coat. 
                    Season with more salt and pepper as needed. Divide among serving plates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fry the goat cheese: Heat a thin layer of oil in a large nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium.
                    Add the breaded goat cheese rounds and cook, turning once, until dark gold, 1 to 2 minutes per side. 
                    Transfer to paper towels to drain, then set over the salad. 
                    Serve immediately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a pinch of minced fresh thyme leaves to the crumb mixture to give the breading a warm, piney contour.
                </li>
            </ol>
